# 0x0D. SQL - Introduction
SQL

What databases are for: Storing data in your application (in memory) has the apparent disadvantage that, regardless of the technology you choose, your data dies when your server stops. Some programming languages and/or frameworks go even farther by being stateless, which implies that your data dies at the end of an HTTP request. Whether your technology is stateless or stateful, you will need to persist your data someplace. That is what databases are for.
